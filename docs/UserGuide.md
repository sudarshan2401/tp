- After editing the student, the `UI` will update to show you the student list of the class that the edited student is in.
- Be careful of any unintended edits that might lead to unwanted results (eg. 2 students with the same name) as they will not be counted as identical students as mentioned in the `Adding a student feature`.

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. When attempting to view a long string of text, the text may be truncated with "..." at the end. The remedy is to resize the window to be larger if possible.
3. When the window size is too small, the alignment of the columns when viewing a class may be off. The remedy is to resize the window to be larger if possible.
