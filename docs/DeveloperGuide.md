### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClassListPanel`, `StudentListPanel` , `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- has specific updates based on certain commands e.g. `ListCommand` will update the `listPanelPlaceholder` to replace the `StudentListPanel` with the `ClassListPanel` and vice versa.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `Class` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/RemoveClassSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remove /c 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `RemoveClassCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `EduTrackParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `RemoveClassCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to remove a class).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `EduTrackParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `EduTrackParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `RemoveClassCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the class administrative data i.e., all `Class` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClassList` object) and `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList`).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Class` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Class>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both EduTrack data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `EduTrackStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Mark student attendance
#### Implementation

<puml src="diagrams/MarkStudentObjectDiagram.puml" alt="MarkStudentObjectDiagram" />


Step 1. The user launches the application

Step 2. The user executes `view /c 1` command to view the students in the 1st class in EduTrack.

Step 3. The user executes `mark /s 1 /c CS2103T` to mark the 1st student in the class CS2103T.

Step 4. `MarkStudentPresentCommandParser` creates a new `MarkStudentPresentCommand` with the required fields.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `MarkStudentPresentCommand#excecute()`.

Step 6. `MarkStudentPresentCommand` calls `Student#duplicateStudent` to create a duplicate Student, `duplicateS`.

Step 7. `MarkStudentPresentCommand` calls `Model#markStudentPresent`.

Step 8. `Model#markStudentPresent` calls `Student#markStudentPresent` to mark the `duplicateS` as present, this updates both `sLessonsAttended` and `sCurrentLessonAttendance`.

Step 9. `Model#markStudentPresent` calls `EduTrack#setStudent` to set `s` as the newly updated `duplicateS` in `EduTrack`'s `globalStudentList`.

Step 10. `Model#markStudentPresent` calls the `Model#setStudentInClass` to set `s` attached to the Class as the updated `duplicateS`.

Step 11. `Model#markStudentPresent` calls the `Model#updateFIlteredStudentList` to update the GUI of Students shown to user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the command fail its execution, both the StudentList in EduTrack as well as StudentList in the class remain unchanged. An error message will be printed to notify the user.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the MarkStudentPresent operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/MarkStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MarkStudentSequenceDiagram"/>

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a use executes the MarkStudentPresentCommand:

<puml src="diagrams/MarkStudentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="MarkStudentActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Method of calculating number of lessons attended

- **Alternative 1 (current choice): Maintain an overall counter for the number of lessons the student attended.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Unable to store the individual state of each lesson. Determining which lesson user attended is not possible.
- **Alternative 2: Maintain the state of each individual lesson with an array.
  - Pros: Enable users to view or modify the state of each individual lesson. May lead to more consistency in data, since the number of lessons and length of array is related.
  - Cons: Difficult to implement. More memory usage, predefined maximum lessons required for array creation, although using ArrayList would be possible as well.

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Edit Student feature
#### Implementation
The `edit /s` command is facilitated by creating an `EditStudentCommand` depending  on the given input.
This command will update the student's details and update the `model` accordingly.

The edit student command accepts:
- Compulsory parameters
  - Student's index in the class
  - Class name of the student's class
- At least one of these parameters
  - Name
  - Id
  - Memo
  - Class Participation

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `edit /s` command.
<puml src="diagrams/EditStudentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="EditStudentActivityDiagram" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit student operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `edit /s 1 /c CS2103T /n John` is given as a user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `EduTrackParser#parseCommand()` to parse the above command into command word `edit /s` and command argument `/s 1 /c CS2103T /n John`.

Step 2. `EditStudentCommandParser` is initialised based on the parse results and `EditStudentCommandParser#parse()` is called. `EditStudentCommandParser#parse()` will call `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to identify all the prefixes such as `Index` of the Student being edited as well as the `ClassName` the student is supposed to be in. (ie. `1` and `CS2103T` respectively). It will also obtain an `ArgumentMultimap` of prefixes to their respective arguments (ie. `/n` is mapped to `John`).

Step 3. `EditStudentCommandParser#parse()` then initialises and EditStudentDescriptor that stores the details to edit the student with. Thus, `EditStudentDescriptor#setName()` will be called to store `John` as the `Name` to be edited.

Step 4. `EditStudentCommandParser#parse()` then initialises an EditStudentCommand with the `Index`, `ClassName` and `EditStudentDescriptor` as an argument. `EditStudentCommand#execute()` is then called, which creates a new `Student` and copies over the details to be edited from the `EditStudentDescriptor` into both the `UniqueStudentList` of the `Class` and `EduTrack`.

Step 5. After checking that the new `Student` is not a duplicate using `Class#hasStudentInClass()` and `Student#isSameStudent()`, `Model#setStudent` and `Model#setStudentInClass` will be called to replace the specified `Student`. Finally, `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` is called to reflect the changes made to the `Student`.

Step 6. `CommandResult` is then initialised with the `String` containing `MESSAGE_EDIT_PERSON_SUCCESS` and `Student` which will then be returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit student operation works:
<puml src="diagrams/EditStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditStudentSequenceDiagram" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

### Remove Student feature
#### Implementation

The removal of Student implements the following operation:
- `EduTrack#removeStudent(Student s)`  — Removes the Student s from List of Students in EduTrack that tracks all students.
- `Class#removeStudent(Student s)`  — Removes the Student s from List of Students in Class that tracks all students in Class.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteStudent(Student s)` and `Model#deleteStudent(Student s, Class sClass)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the remove student mechanism at a high level:

Step 1. The user inputs `remove /s 1 /c CS2103T` command to remove the first `Student` in the class named "CS2103T".

Step 2. `Logic`is called upon to execute the above command, it is passed to an `EduTrackParser` object which in turns 
create a `RemoveStudentCommandParser` and uses it to parse the command.

Step 3. This results in `RemoveStudentCommand`, referred as `cmd` in this scenario, which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Step 4. `cmd` communicates with the `Model` when executed to remove the first `Student` in `Class` CS2103T.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back to `Logic`.

The scenario is depicted by this sequence diagram. For execution of `cmd`, refer to this [sequence diagram](#execution-of-a-removestudentcommand).
##### Remove Student Mechanism
<puml src="diagrams/RemoveStudentSequenceDiagramPart1.puml" alt="RemoveStudentSequenceDiagramPart1" />
**Note:** The lifeline for `RemoveStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
The mechanism to execute a `RemoveStudentCommand` is elaborated in the below walkthrough.
This is a list of variables used in the walkthrough for clarity.

**Variables used:**

`cmd` - `RemoveStudentCommand` communicates with `Model` to remove a `Student`

`s` - `Student` to be removed.

`sName` - `Name` representing `s`.

`sClass` - `Class` of `s`.

`studentClassName` - `ClassName` representing `sClass`.

`sClassStudentList` - `UniqueStudentList` in `sClass` containing all its `Student`

`globalStudentList` - `UniqueStudentList` in `EduTrack` containing all `Student` across all `Class`.

The relationship between variables can be summarised by this object [diagram](#relationship-between-key-variables).

##### Relationship between key variables
<puml src="diagrams/RemoveStudentObjectDiagram.puml" alt="RemoveStudentObjectDiagram" />

**Walkthrough**

Step 1. `LogicManager` calls `RemoveStudentCommand#execute()`.
 
Step 2. `cmd` calls `Model#getClass(studentClassName)` to get `sClass`.

Step 3. `cmd` calls `Model#getStudentList(sClass)` to get the `sClassStudentList` from `sClass`.

Step 4. `cmd` calls `Model#getStudent(sClassStudentList, 1)` to get `s`, the first student in the `sClassStudentList`.

Step 5. `cmd` calls `Model#getStudentName(s)` to get `sName`.

Step 6. `cmd` calls  `Model#deleteStudent(s, sClass)` to remove `s` from `sClassStudentList`.

Step 7. `cmd` calls `Model#deleteStudent(s)` to remove `s` from `globalStudentList`.

Step 8. The result of the `cmd`'s execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object.

Step 9. `cmd` returns `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

The walkthrough can be summarised by this sequence diagram. (Some details are omitted in the diagram)

##### Execution of a `RemoveStudentCommand`
<puml src="diagrams/RemoveStudentSequenceDiagramPart2.puml" alt="RemoveStudentSequenceDiagramPart2" />
**Note:** The lifeline for `Student` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
The following activity diagram summarises what happen when a user removes a Student:

##### Remove Student Workflow
<puml src="diagrams/RemoveStudentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="RemoveStudentActivityDiagram" />

**Implementation reasoning:**
1. `RemoveStudentCommand` leverages multiple methods from other classes to enhance abstraction, ultimately promoting higher cohesion within the system.
2. `RemoveStudentCommand` is responsible for deletion of `s` from `globalStudentList` under `EduTrack` to enable creation of `Student` with same `Name` in the future. This is necessary because `EduTrack` enforces the uniqueness of student names in the `globalStudentList`.

### View Class feature

#### Implementation

The View Command feature allows users to list all students in a specified class. It is implemented as follows:

- `Model#updateFilteredClassList(Predicate<Class> predicate)` — Updates the filtered class list based on a given predicate. This is used to display the specified class along with its students.

- `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` — Updates the filtered student list based on a given predicate. In this case, it filters students belonging to the specified class.

- `Model#getClassByIndex(Index classIndex)` — Retrieves the class object based on the provided index.

- `Class#getStudentList()` — Gets the list of students associated with a specific class.

- `Class#getClassName()` — Gets the name of the class for display purposes.

- `CommandResult` — Returns a command result with a success message indicating the class name.

The workflow of the View Command feature is outlined below:

1. The user invokes the View Command with a specified class index.

2. The command is executed, calling the appropriate methods in the `Model`.

3. The `Model` updates the filtered class list to be reset to all classes.

4. The specified class is retrieved using the class index.

5. The `Model` updates the filtered class list again, this time with a predicate that filters for the specified class.

6. The filtered student list is updated to show only students belonging to the specified class.

7. The command returns a success message with the name of the class.

**Variables used:**

- `classIndex` - The index of the class specified by the user.

- `classToView` - The class object corresponding to the specified index.

- `classToTest` - A class used in the filtering predicate.

- `student` - A student object used in the filtering predicate.

The interaction between these variables is illustrated in the following object diagram:
<puml src="diagrams/ViewClassObjectDiagram.puml" alt="ViewClassObjectDiagram" />

#### Walkthrough

1. LogicManager calls `ViewCommand#execute()`.

2. `ViewCommand` calls `Model#getClassByIndex(classIndex)` to retrieve the class object corresponding to the specified index.

3. `ViewCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredClassList(Predicate<Class> predicate)` to update the filtered class list.

4. `ViewCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` to update the filtered student list which is displayed on the UI.

5. `ViewCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The interaction between these variables is illustrated in the following sequence diagram:
<puml src="diagrams/ViewClassSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewClassSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the View Command:
<puml src="diagrams/ViewClassActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ViewClassActivityDiagram" />

### Add a class feature

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add class mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `add /c cs2103t` command to add a new class with the class name "CS2103T". The `add /c` command calls `Parser#AddClassCommandParser` to retrieve the provided class name argument.

Step 3. A new `Class` is created with the specified class name, an empty student list, an empty class note and empty class schedule.

Step 4. The created `Class` is added to `UniqueClassList` if it does not exists in UniqueClassList. Then the `Storage` is updated to save the current state of `EduTrack`.

<puml src="diagrams/AddAClassObjectDiagram.puml" alt="AddAClassObjectDiagram" />

Step 5. The application prints the successful message to the user. UI automatically updates the current state of the shown class list.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**

- The received class name will be converted to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method.
- If the command fails its execution, the class list remains unchanged and an error message will be printed to notify the user.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add class operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddAClassSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddAClassSequenceDiagram" />

1. `LogicManager#execute()` is called.
2. `EduTrackParse#parseCommand()` is called.
3. `AddClassCommandParser#parse()` is called, a new `Class c` is created. Returns `AddClassCommand addClassCommand`.
4.  `addClassCommand` calls `Model#hasClass(c)`. If class does not exists, calls `Model#addClass(c)`.
5.  `addClassCommand` returns `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a new Class is added:

<puml src="diagrams/AddAClassActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddAClassActivityDiagram" />

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: The number of parameters required**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new class with only class name.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Needs to use another command to update class note and class schedule.

- **Alternative 2:** Creates a new class with class name, class note and class schedule.

  - Pros: All information are specified by the time the class is created.
  - Cons: Requires the user to provide additional details like class notes or class schedule

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

School of Computing (SoC) tutor who:

- has a need to manage classes with a significant number of students
- needs to do tasks like taking attendance, and keeping track of class participation
- prefer desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Each tutor has multiple groups of students where each group can be large, keeping track of students and records would become a hassle. Our product provides a centralised system that would help to organise all student records for easy and quick access.

### Saving data

Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

1. Make sure that there is a `./data/edutrack.json` file. <br>
   If not, open the application (the jar file) and make some changes (e.g. `add /c T1`) and close the app (by typing in the `exit` command or clicking on the close button).

2. Open `./data/edutrack.json` in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

3. Remove the starting `{` character of the JSON file and save the file.

4. Launch the app by running `java -jar edutrack.jar` in the console or double-click the application. <br>
   Expected: The GUI should pop up with no entries. The console should give warnings about incorrect data format (due to the removal of the `{` character at the start of the `edutrack.json` file). Now, you can start over and add whatever entries you want.<br>
   Note: If you want to start with populated data, delete the entire `edutrack.json` file and launch the application.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Enhancement to validation of identical students
    <br><br>
    As of now, to validate that 2 students are identical, the method `isSameStudent` check if all `Student`'s fields: name, id, total attendance, current attendance, memo and class participation are equal.
    <br><br>
    Thus, this allows the user to create (through adding or editing) 2 students that have 1 differing field apart from the name and id field. For example, there can be two `Student` with name Bob, id A0123456Z but one with a memo of "Actively asks question during class" and another with an empty memo. This can be confusing for the user if done unintentionally as the GUI would show 2 students that seem to represent the same student.
    <br><br>
    Enhancement to be made:
    The method `isSameStudent` will be adjusted so that 2 students are identical if and only if both their name and id are the same. This will ensure every student is unique (based on name and id) in EduTrack (i.e. even between different classes).
