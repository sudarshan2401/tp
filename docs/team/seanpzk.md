### Project: EduTrack

EduTrack is a powerful desktop app designed for SOC tutors. It allows them to streamline their teaching tasks and effortlessly track their class and student records.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to EduTrack.

* **New Features**:
  * Added the ability to remove student from his or her class.
    * <u>What it does</u>
    <br>It allows users to easily remove a student from their class.
    * <u>Justification</u>
    <br>This feature streamlines class roster updates, accommodating user errors in student placement and
    facilitating adjustments when students leave their classes for various reasons.

  * Added the ability to simulate the start of a lesson.
    * <u>What it does</u>
    <br>It helps user to update multiple class records when initiating a new lesson. It automatically increments the total lesson count and resets the attendance sheet for marking student attendance.
    * <u>Justification</u>
    <br>This feature streamlines class record updates, eliminating the need for multiple manual commands.

  * Added the ability to manually set the number of lessons conducted for a class.
    * <u>What it does</u>
      <br>It allows user to set the specific number of lessons conducted for a class.
    * <u>Justification</u>
      <br>EduTrack can track the number of lessons conducted for a class by the number of times `Start Lesson` command is used. However, if the user unintentionally `Start Lesson`, this allows the user to correct the number of lessons conducted easily.
